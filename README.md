# 🐚 minishell

Hello fellas! 👋  
Welcome to my **minishell** project — a simplified implementation of a Unix shell written in C.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This is **not an optimized version**, so please **do not use it as a reference** for production or learning purposes. It’s a work in progress and more of a personal experiment.

## 📌 About
This project is part of my journey into learning systems programming and building custom shells. It handles basic shell functionality and aims to replicate some behaviors of real-world shells like `bash`.

## 🚧 Status
- 🚫 Not optimized
- 🚀 Functional (basic commands work)
- 🔧 The enhanced version will be pushed soon

- Thanks for checking it out! 🙂
